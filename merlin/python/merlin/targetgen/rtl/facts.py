"""Target-agnostic resolution of RTL-derived facts and the introspect run/cache location.

RTL facts are a **generated artifact**: they are what our CIRCT/firtool tooling EXTRACTS from the
target's RTL (``circt_introspect`` -> the HW-dialect decoder/op graph), never a hand-committed file.
There is no committed ``facts.json`` pin any more — the artifact lives in the **purgeable** cache
(``out/artifacts/cache/rtl_introspect/<target>/facts.json``, gitignored) and is REGENERATED on demand
by :func:`ensure_facts` when the cache is cold. A target's only tracked definition is its reviewed
yaml (``target_contract.yaml`` + the human-owned ``dialect_plan.yaml``).

This module is the single place that maps a target name -> its facts artifact and its purgeable
scratch dir, so no consumer hardcodes the gemmini path (they used to, with three different
``parents[]`` depths). Mirrors :func:`merlin.targetgen.contract.schemas.contract_dir`.
